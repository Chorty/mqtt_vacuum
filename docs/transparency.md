### Colours Transparency ###

The colour used in the creation of each element of the maps are RGBA.
The Alpha chanel of the colour "A" (transparency) is customizable from the camera options.
At the initial setup of the camera, the colours Alpha data load in the configration are default.

Those values are:
255 = Full color no transparency.
0 = Transparent = not visible. 

As per we build several layers one on the top of the other applying transparency to one of the colour used can result
in interesting colour mixtures :)

At the bottom of the colours configuration pages there is a switch that will display the transparency settings relative
to the colours you just edited. By turning on the "Configure Transparency" this page will be shown.

It is possible to use the slide bar or simply input the value.

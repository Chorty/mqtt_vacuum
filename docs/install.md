***On Versions below "<" v1.4.0*** the MQTT Client embedded in this Integration will need to be configured, depending from your Home Assistant MQTT setup the integration will connect MQTT to estract the Vacuums maps. If you are using the Home Assistant MQTT core (no external MQTT) by default the camera will connect this, althought you need to provide the MQTT credentials you used to configure the Vacuum on MQTT (not the crediantials that HA use to connect the MQTT broker) and topic to follow for the client.

MQTT Host can be configured eiter by IP or Host name. The host name **"core-mosquitto" vaule is default for all users using the [official Home Assistant MQTT addon](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)**. In this filed it is important to use the same vaule used and your MQTT configuration.

The configuration of the colours you would prefer for each element in the maps can be done via Options. The camera will is connect automatically to the HA MQTT (whatever setup you use), for each vacuum you configured a new entity will be added to the configuration.

The camera entity created will have the same friendly name of your vacuum + "camera" at the end. For example vacuum.robot1 = camera.robot1_camera.

After this fist step the MQTT Client embedded in this Integration will need to be configured, depending from your Home Assistant MQTT setup the integration will connect MQTT to estract the Vacuums maps. If you are using the Home Assistant MQTT core (no external MQTT) by default the camera will connect this, althought you need to provide the MQTT credentials and topic to follow for the client.

The host name **"core-mosquitto" vaule is default for all users using the [official Home Assistant MQTT addon](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)**.

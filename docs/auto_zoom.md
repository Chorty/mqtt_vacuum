***Default:***  Disable

***Description:*** If the vacuum supports the segments and those are properly configured also in the card, when the
vacuum enters the room to clean the Camera will zoom the image on that room.

***Note:*** The zoom works only when the vacuum is in “cleaning” state. In all other states the image returns
automatically to the floor plan. If the auto zoom is disabled the floor map is displayed normally, cleaned or in clean
mode segments are highlighted on the map by a faded selected color.

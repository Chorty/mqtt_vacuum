**Description:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT.
This Custom Component allow to integrate the Vacuum functionalities and encode the Vacuum Map embedded on the image the vacuum send to mqtt.
This Integration can decode the vacuum map and render it to Home Assistant, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (reccomended) from HACS as well.

### Changes on Release: v1.1.2
- Integration Config Flow setup is now possible via Home Assistant UI.
- The camera entity unique ID is provided to home assistant.


### How to install:
Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) add integration, and copy the repository link in ***new repository*** section.
Once installed the integration can be configured via integration / add integration and search Valetudo Camera.
If you prefer to add the integration via the configuration.yaml please use the following configuration lines:


```
camera:
    - platform: valetudo_vacuum_camera
        vacuum_entity: "vacuum.your_vacuum"
        vacuum_map: "valetudo/your_vacuum_topic"
        borker_User: "broker_user_name"
        broker_Password: "broker_password"
        scan_interval:
            seconds: 15
```

To know the MQTT topic your_vacuum use you might use the vacuum web GUI.
copy the Topic Prefix/Identifier **only** please and past it as a sting in the
vacuum_map required field.

This custom component is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allow
us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant.
It was developed to work in together with below card, that gives the possible to operate the vacuum and the integration is
already providing the required calibration data. Please click on
the link and follow the detailed instruction on how to [setup the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card](
https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card/tree/master).


in the card configuration you might configure as following the
calibration_source and internal_variables as following:
```

type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_silenttepidstinkbug
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera
calibration_source:
  camera: true
internal_variables:
  topic: valetudo/your_topic
tiles:
  - tile_id: battery_level
    .....

```

After that, you can easily generate the service calls to integrate or control
your Vacuum via Home Assistant.

**The current tasks list is:**
- [ ] Get from the json data predicted_path and selected_area.
- [ ] Grab the available consumable data form MQTT.
- [ ] Confirm Reset functions for consumables.
- [x] Fix config_flow in order to meet HA requirements (including UniqueID).

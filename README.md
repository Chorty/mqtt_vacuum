**Description:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT.
This Custom Component allow to integrate the Vacuum functionalities and encode the Vacuum Map embedded on the image the vacuum send to mqtt.
This Integration can decode the vacuum map and render it to Home Assistant, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended) from HACS as well.
Configuration of the card once the camera is selected requires:
calibration source to be set to camera: true
```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_silenttepidstinkbug
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```


### Current Release: v1.1.5
1) Adding cropping and rotation options the users can now customize the image output.
2) Enhancing the image_handler module to handle empty data and avoid unnecessary computations during image creation (reported on issues 4). This ensures that only relevant data is processed, improving efficiency and reducing potential errors.
3) Buffering the background image and redrawing it every 5 frames.
4) Making changes to the routine that draws the robot and flag for Go to Function.
5) Introducing a function to bypass MQTT in a test scenario, still a work in progress but do not affect the data collection.
6) Implementing data collection to expand the range of supported vacuums.
   1) New folder "snapshots" in the integration base folder since v1.1.5
   2) in snapshot will be automatically stored a png in case the vacuum is docked, idle or error.
   3) additionally formatted json data and when available the mqtt raw payload will be saved.
   NOTE: It is in plan to use the camera snapshot functions so that in case the battery of the vacuum is dead will be more easy to locate it. It will be possible to send the last position of the vacuum setting up the notification in HA.

### How to install:
Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) add integration, and copy the repository link in ***new repository*** section.
Once installed the integration can be configured via integration / add integration and search Valetudo Camera.
If you prefer to add the integration via the configuration.yaml please use the following configuration lines:


```
camera:
    - platform: valetudo_vacuum_camera
        vacuum_entity: "vacuum.your_vacuum"
        vacuum_map: "valetudo/your_vacuum_topic"
        borker_User: "broker_user_name"
        broker_Password: "broker_password"
        rotate_image: integer value image clock wise rotation values 0, 90, 180, or 270.
        crop_image: 0 integer value = 100% of the image is redered. 25 is reducing the image of 75%.
        scan_interval:
            seconds: 5
```

To know the MQTT topic your_vacuum use you might use the vacuum web GUI.
copy the Topic Prefix/Identifier **only**. Please and past it as a sting in the
vacuum_map required field.

This custom component is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows
us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant.
It was developed to work in together with below card, that gives the possible to operate the vacuum and the integration is
already providing the required calibration data. Please click on
the link and follow the detailed instruction on how to [set up the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card](
https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card/tree/master).


in the card configuration you might configure as following the
calibration_source and internal_variables as following:
```

type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_silenttepidstinkbug
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera
calibration_source:
  camera: true
internal_variables:
  topic: valetudo/your_topic
tiles:
  - tile_id: battery_level
    .....

```

After that, you can easily generate the service calls to integrate or control
your Vacuum via Home Assistant.

**Checked before release:**
- [x] Configuration via GUI. (user interface will be improved on V1.1.6)
- [x] No errors after installation (at first init the image will be gray)
- [x] Reporting the calibration data will take a while, please wait until the init is complete.
- [x] Go to and ara cleaning tested.
- [x] Camera reload okay.
- [x] Camera entry delete okay.

**About:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT.

**What it is:**
This Integration decode the vacuum map and render it to Home Assistant, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.
Configuration of the card once the camera is selected requires:
calibration source to be set to camera: true
This will pass automatically the data to the card.

This custom component is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows
us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant.

Note: The test in Github is still not fully setup this is why there is an X instead of a V. We don't pass the 84% of test for this reason.

- [x] Configuration via GUI. 
- [x] No errors after installation (at first init the image will be gray)

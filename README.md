# Valetudo Vacuum Camera
## Integration for Valetudo Vacuums to Home Assistant


![img_1](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/assets/82227818/78752c27-1754-4d1f-9109-3003b36a1900)

**About:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Hypfer Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT, [easy setup](./docs/install.md) thanks to [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)  and guided configuration via Home Assistant GUI.

**What it is:**
Recently designed successor of ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo is [ValetudoPNG](https://github.com/erkexzcx/valetudopng) that can be used as alternative, althought we wanted to simplify the setup of a camera that decode the vacuum maps and render it to Home Assistant, therefore, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.

Configuration of the card (thanks to [@PiotrMachowski](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski)) once the camera is installed requires:

*calibration source to be set to camera **not to identity**.*
```
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
```

The below pass automatically the data to use the card please do not forget to use the **internal_variables** *your topic can be retrived also from the camera attribe vacuum_topic.* 

```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_yourvacuum
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```

**Known Supported Vacuums:**
- Dreame D9
- Dreame Z10 Pro
- Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop P
- Roborock.S5
- Roborock.S50
- Roborock.V1
- Xiaomi C1
- Give us feedback please ;) (waiting for your vacuum to be add to the list as in general it works with all flashed Valetudo vacuums)

### Current Release: [![GitHub Latest Release][releases_shield]][latest_release]

### How to install:
Via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz//setup/download) please follow the instructions in [here](./docs/install.md). This detailed guide will help to set up the camera.

## Features:
1) **Automatically Generate the calibration points for the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card** to ensure full compatibility to this user-friendly card.
2) **Automatically Generate rooms based configuration when vacuum support this functionality**, this will allow you to configure the rooms quickly on the [lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card).
3) **The camera take automatically [snapshots](./docs/snapshots.md) (when the vacuum idle/ error / docked)**
4) **Change the image options** directly form the Home Assistant integration UI with a simple click on the integration configuration.
 - **Image Rotation**: 0, 90, 180, 270 (default is 0).
 - [*Cropping function*](./docs/croping_trimming.md) (default is 50% of the standard Valetudo size 5210x5210 = 2605x2605).
 - Base colors are the **colors for robot, charger, walls, background, zones etc**.
 - **Rooms colors**, Room 1 is acrually also the Floor color (for vacuum that do not supports rooms).
 - From v1.3.2 is possible to [**Trim the images**](./docs/croping_trimming.md) as desidered.
 - It is possible to **display on the image the vacuum staus**.
 - We also added the **[transparency level custom setup](./docs/transparency.md) for all elements and rooms** from v1.4.2.  
5) This integration make possible to **integrate multiple vacuums** as per each camera will be named with the vacuum name (example: vacuum.robot1 = camera.robot1.. vacuum.robotx = camera.robotx)
6) The camera as all cameras in HA **supports the ON/OFF service**, it is possible to *suspend and resume the camera streem as desired*.

## In plan:
- Improving the rooms zones export to the card (at current it requires manual adjustments).
- Add support for Valetudo RE firmware as well. So doing, we wish to expand the easy way to get integrated in home assistant all Valetudo Vacuums ;)


## Notes:
- This integration is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant. Tested also on Docker Supervised "production" enviroment (fully setup home installation).

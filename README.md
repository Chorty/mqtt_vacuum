# Valetudo Vacuum Camera
## Integration for Valetudo Vacuums to Home Assistant


![img_1](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/assets/82227818/78752c27-1754-4d1f-9109-3003b36a1900)

**About:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT.

**What it is:**
This Integration decode the vacuum map and render it to Home Assistant, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.

Configuration of the card (thanks to @PiotrMachowski) once the camera is selected requires:
calibration source to be set to camera: true

This will pass automatically the data to the card.

```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_yourvacuum
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```

**Supported Vacuums:**
- RoborockV1
- RoborockS5
- Dreame D9


### Current Release: ![GitHub Latest Release][releases_shield]

### How to install:
Please foolow the instructions in [here](./docs/install.md).

This custom component is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows
us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant. Tested also on Docker Supervised "production" enviroment (fully setup home installation).

Note: The test in Github is still not fully setup this is why there is an X instead of a V. We don't pass the 84% of test for this reason.

## Futures:
1) Generate the calibration points for the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card to ensure full compatibility to this user friendly card.
2) Generate rooms based configuration when vaccum support this fucntionality, this will allow you 
3) The camera take automaticly a snapshot (vacuum idle/ error / docked) and sore it in the www folder of HA. It is thefore possible to create an automation to send the screenshot to your mobile in different conditions as per below example:

```
alias: Vacuum Error 
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - vacuum.valetudo_yor_vacuum
    from: error
    for:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 30
condition: []
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      message: Vacuum idle
      data:
        image: /local/your_vacuum_snapshot.png
mode: single
```

3) Change the image options directly form the HA integratios UI with a click on configuration.

### In plan:
1) The entity ID of the camera will be based on the vacuum name, this will be usfull to setup multiple vacuums and cameras.
2) Improving the rooms zones export to the card (at current it requires manual adjustments).

## Tanks to:
- @PiotrMachowski inspiring this integration and his amazing work.
- @Hypfer for freeing the vacuums from the clouds and contiunsly improvig our vacuums :)
- @billyourself for providing us the data to evolve this project.
- And to all of you using this integration and reporting any issues, improvemnts and vacuums used with it.

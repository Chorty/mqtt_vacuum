**About:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT.

**What it is:**
This Integration decode the vacuum map and render it to Home Assistant, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.
Configuration of the card once the camera is selected requires:
calibration source to be set to camera: true
This will pass automatically the data to the card.

```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_yourvacuum
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```

**Supported Vacuums:**
- RoborockV1
- Dreame D9


### Current Release: v1.1.9
1. Snapshots function is available since version 1.1.5 but is updated on the 1.1.9 where image will be stored on www folder instead of the integration snapshot folder.
   with this modification is possible to use the notification service of HA as following:
```example automation
alias: Vacuum Idle
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - vacuum.valetudo_your_vacuum
    from: idle
    for:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 30
condition: []
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      message: Vacuum idle
      data:
        image: /local/valetudo_snapshot.png
mode: single
```
2. Names of the rooms to send directly to the card are currently display only as values on the camera attributes.

### How to install:
Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) add integration, and copy the repository link in ***new repository*** section.
Once installed the integration can be configured via integration / add integration and search Valetudo Camera.

To know the MQTT topic your_vacuum use you might use the vacuum web GUI.
copy the Topic Prefix/Identifier **only**. Please and past it as a sting in the
vacuum_map required field.

This custom component is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows
us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant.

Note: The test in Github is still not fully setup this is why there is an X instead of a V. We don't pass the 84% of test for this reason.

## Futures:
1) Generate the calibration points for the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card to ensure full compatibility to this user friendly card.
2) The camera take automaticly a snapshot (vacuum idle/ error / docked) and sore it in the www folder of HA. It is thefore possible to create an automation to send the screenshot to your mobile in different conditions as per below example:

```
alias: Vacuum Idle or Error
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - vacuum.valetudo_silenttepidstinkbug
    from: idle
    for:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 30
condition: []
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      message: Vacuum idle
      data:
        image: /local/valetudo_snapshot.png
mode: single
```

3) Change the image options directly form the HA integratios UI with a click on configuration.

### In plan:
1) We will also add the capability to show segments names and active state for Dreame D9 vacuums on v1.1.9.

**Description:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT.
This Custom Component allow to integrate the Vacuum functionalities and encode the Vacuum Map embedded on the image the vacuum send to mqtt.

**Supported Vacuums:**
- RoborockV1
- Dreame D9

If you encounter issues integrating a not listed vacuum please open a discussion.

This Integration decode the vacuum map and render it to Home Assistant, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.
Configuration of the card once the camera is selected requires:
calibration source to be set to camera: true
This will pass automatically the data to the card.

```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_silenttepidstinkbug
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```


### Current Release: v1.1.6
1) Dreame D9 Map Drawing, rooms, no go areas and paths are now correctly draw. 
2) Resolves #6 issue in the Image Handler the image now load as it should.
3) We did separate the MQTT payload to have one payload dedicated only for the image processing.
4) Crop default is 50%. This would avoid HA instance to be over load with huge amount of data. Please use a crop factor <50 (example values between 20 and 40) when you want the image to be smaller (zoomed)
### In plan:
1) User interface could not be improved on V1.1.6 as per we did mainly work on the integration of the new vacuum. We set now as target v1.2.0.  
2) Use the camera snapshot functions so that in case the battery of the vacuum is dead will be easy to locate it. It will be possible to send the last position of the vacuum setting up the notification in HA.
3) Improve the frames rate.
4) Adding to the configuration the colour setup for each element.

### How to install:
Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) add integration, and copy the repository link in ***new repository*** section.
Once installed the integration can be configured via integration / add integration and search Valetudo Camera.
If you prefer to add the integration via the configuration.yaml please use the following configuration lines:


```
camera:
    - platform: valetudo_vacuum_camera
        vacuum_entity: "vacuum.your_vacuum"
        vacuum_map: "valetudo/your_vacuum_topic"
        borker_User: "broker_user_name"
        broker_Password: "broker_password"
        rotate_image: integer value image clock wise rotation values 0, 90, 180, or 270.
        crop_image: 0 integer value = 100% of the image is redered. 25 is reducing the image of 75%.
        scan_interval:
            seconds: 5
```

To know the MQTT topic your_vacuum use you might use the vacuum web GUI.
copy the Topic Prefix/Identifier **only**. Please and past it as a sting in the
vacuum_map required field.

This custom component is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows
us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant.

Note: The test in Github is not fully setup this is why there is an X instead of a V

**Checked before release:**
- [x] Configuration via GUI. 
- [x] No errors after installation (at first init the image will be gray)
- [x] Reporting the calibration data will take a while, please wait until the init is complete.
- [x] Go to and ara cleaning tested.
- [x] Camera reload okay.
- [x] Camera entry delete okay.
